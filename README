xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

From Jan 2023 to May 2023, I completed all the lectures and labs for MIT 6.s081 (https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/).
This repo together with https://github.com/YuZhang37/xv6-labs-2020 contains implementation on 12 labs from the course.
